This project demonstrates multivariate classification using neuromorphic hardware, 
in this case the SpiNNaker hardware platform [1].
The classifier neural model design is based on that published in [2,3] which is a 
bio-inspired design based on the insect olfactory system.

The core requirements to run these programs is Python 2.7 and a SpiNNaker board with 
the accompanying software suite made available from MAnchester Universtiy;
The work is demonstrated here in a series of Python/PynNN/sPyNNaker experiments of 
increasing complexity/difficulty.
In all these experiments, for those unable to run the program themselves, screenshot(s) of the 
relevant raster plots are made available in the "screenshots" subdirectory.

EXPERIMENT 1
This experiment demonstrates a basic ability to use synapse plasticity to learn to 
classify ("recognise") 10 digits taken from the standard MNIST dataset.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This work is supported by a grant from the Human Brain Project (HBP).
The SpiNNaker hardware platform is developed at Manchester University who supplied the board and software suite used in this work.
